                        <li>Ending a 3 year conflict is a very complex conflict, with dynamics from all sides. Furthermore, ending the war economy</li>
                        <li>Past attempts by President Trump to achieve a diplomatic solution such as in North Korea have yielded mixed results.</li>
                        <li>A core belief of Ukraine when surrending is that they are guranteed into NATO. This is vehemently rejected by Russia, as it will mean a core part of 
                            the territory of the Soviet Union would not be under Russian sphere of influence. As Vladimir Putin refers to Soviet Union as the good old days, it is untenable.</li>

                            conservatives are pinning Canada's economic woes . This is a strong message that resonates with the public.

                            if not decades for these policies to take effect.  It likely won't take effect fast enough for the 2025 election.

                            against Canada. This could garner public support.

                            Just because the conservatives are leading in the polls, doesn't gurantee their win.
                            Especially in politics, opinions can swing very quickly. Since the election is happening this year,
                            there are still enough time for opinions to swing back to favor the liberals, albeit unlikely.
