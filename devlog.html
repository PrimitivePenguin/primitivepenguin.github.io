            <p>
                I've always wanted to do a website of some form for the past 2 years, so I'm glad
                I'm able to start this. I hope to use this website both as a porfolio and a place to explore whatever random thoughts I have.
                I was inspired to create this by a friend of my father, who has built his own website since 1998. 
                <a target="_blank"href="https://www.hirax.net">Here is the link to his website.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly I am very embarassed by the abysmal state of the website. Just because it's the first version doesn't mean
                I can publish it as barebone and messy as this... I'll update this website frequently until satisfied,
                then move onto a more consistent upload schedule. This just might be the most updated section of this website for a while...
            </p>

                <b>Things to work on:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Deal with the mess that is the roadmap on the front page. I coded it somehow, but I still have no idea why things are the way it is.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Minimalist design did not work. I was inspired by Apple, and other websites, but many of the minimalist designs
                        focus on the product for sale. My product is the content, so I need to do more research. Perhaps the gov.uk is a good reference.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used table to line up the various elements on the front, but I would like it to be less weird... It reeks of being a prototype T_T
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the forecasting section, line up the margins (Also add more forecasts)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More color! White, black, and gray is so dull
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have enough content it's not a problem, but if there's not enough like in project section right now,
                        the footer sticks to the content section and it looks like the page ends abruptly (well it does)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="footer">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Ringo Kojima
                </td>
                <td>

                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">Â© 2025 Ringo Kojima</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
