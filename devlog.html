            <b>Updated how contour maps are rendered - 2025/09/06</b><br>
            <p>
                Before, when the contour map was rendered per level, it generated by drawing a line from one point to the next randomly.
                By repeating this process it managed to create a contour map. However, if I want to make the lines into curves and other shapes,
                 I need to determine what shapes each line forms. I've implemented this by building an adjacency map for each edge, 
                 then traversing it until it reached the end (then traversing it again in the opposite direction until I hit the other edge)
                 for lines that hit the border of the rendering container, or until it loops again back to the start.

            <b>Testing Contour Map for Background - 2025/09/02</b><br>
            <p>
                To design a presentable homepage, I've decided to make a dynamic contour map as the background.
                I created the background by making an array of points which is then applied to a Perlin noise generated random background.
                Then a Marching Square Algorithm by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZONMNUKTfU" target = "_blank">The Coding Train</a> is used to generate the lines.
                The points are then seperated into different groups based on the layer.
                The contour map is then animated by changing the z value of the Perlin noise over time.<br>
                Some features I would like to implement in the future are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply some kind of rendering like Bezier curves to curved portion of the contour map so that it doesn't look so jagged</li>
                    <li>Sliding scales and a way to change the values easily. Right now it is a pain to make minor adjustments</li>
                    <li>Way to change the FPS of the animation - Some of my friends who I've asked for feedback says that it needs a flash warning, 
                        while others say that it is too jagged and needs to run smoother
                    </li>
                    <li>Related to the previous point, a way to make it more efficient. Currently if I run it too fast, it consumes all my CPU resources and RAM.</li>
                </ul>

            <b>Design sprint Day 2 - 2025/01/18</b><br>
            <p>
                I finished the first day of the design sprint yesterday. 
                It turns out that if I have other tasks aside from working on the website, it's difficult to keep myself on track. 
                I completed day 1 yesterday, but I underestimated the challenge of writing and summarizing my thoughts into a coherent summary that doesn't ramble on forever. 
                I will continue to try to keep the design sprint consistent, but I'm uncertain how everything will go. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Going forward, I will pay close attention to the time management aspect of writing articles.
                I am considering trying to split the writing and the design sprint into two seperate tasks,
                but that would defeat the point of the design sprint. I think the way forwards for articles for the design sprints,
                are to keep it straight to the point.

            <b>Design sprint Day 1 - 2025/01/17</b><br>
            <p>
                The research and brainstorm I've done today is too long to be a devlog, so I'll be posting this as a seperate article.
                This is also a good chance to have an article and see what it looks like. Also I've started to use git for source control,
                I can see why everyone uses it.<br>

            <p>
                I was reading about this concept of a design sprint - A way to design and test a prototype in 5 days.
                This consists of a step in 5 days - Understand (the customer), Ideate, Decide (the idea), Prototype, and Test.
                According to Google Ventures, this design sprint is usually done by a team with a specific goal in mind,
                but since I'm doing this alone, and planning on updating the website as a whole, I'll be modifying it into:
                
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>01/17 (Friday) - Research the audience and design a prototype</li>
                <li>01/18 (Saturday) - Turn the concepts into more concrete solutions, into basic designs</li>
                <li>01/19 (Sunday) - Create individual components</li>
                <li>01/20 (Monday) - Combine each of the modules into a cohesive website</li>
                <li>01/21 (Tuesday) - Complete it, and get reviews from others (then somehow implement feedback)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I'll post an update later today

            <p>
                I've always wanted to do a website of some form for the past 2 years, so I'm glad
                I'm able to start this. I hope to use this website both as a porfolio and a place to explore whatever random thoughts I have.
                I was inspired to create this by a friend of my father, who has built his own website since 1998. 
                <a target="_blank"href="https://www.hirax.net">Here is the link to his website.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly I am very embarassed by the abysmal state of the website. Just because it's the first version doesn't mean
                I can publish it as barebone and messy as this... I'll update this website frequently until satisfied,
                then move onto a more consistent upload schedule. This just might be the most updated section of this website for a while...
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Things to work on:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Deal with the mess that is the roadmap on the front page. I coded it somehow, but I still have no idea why things are the way it is.

                    <li>
                        Minimalist design did not work. I was inspired by Apple, and other websites, but many of the minimalist designs
                        focus on the product for sale. My product is the content, so I need to do more research. Perhaps the gov.uk is a good reference.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used table to line up the various elements on the front, but I would like it to be less weird... It reeks of being a prototype T_T
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the forecasting section, line up the margins (Also add more forecasts)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More color! White, black, and gray is so dull
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have enough content it's not a problem, but if there's not enough like in project section right now,
                        the footer sticks to the content section and it looks like the page ends abruptly (well it does)
                    </li>
                </ul>
