        <h3>Design Sprint 1 Day 1 - Research and Brainstorm Ideas</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this website will be twofold - as a portfolio,
             and as a way for me to explore whatever I'm curious about.
             Given that this is going to be part portfolio and part blog,
             I should consider the audience that I want to attract.
             Below is a list of potential audiences I assume would be attracted to my website over the short, medium, and long term.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Short-term</b> (1-3 years)</td>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Potential employees / clients / recruiters</li>
                        <li>Friends and family</li>
                        <li>Other people who are interested in my website</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Mid-term</b> (3-10 years)</td>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Industry peers</li>
                        <li>Peers that are interested in my work</li>
                        <li>Visitors who are interested in my projects</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Long-term</b> (10+ years)</td>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Established audience who are interested in science made accessible</li>
                        <li>Industry professionals or recruiters offering senior positions</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            As of now, I will only focus on what I believe to be the two biggest audiences - 
            potential employees and general audiences who are interested in my work.
        </p><br>
        Down below is a rough psychologocial profile of the two main audiences that I want to attract.
        <table>
            <thead>

              </tr>
            </thead>

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Trust Factors</td>

          </table>
          <p>
          Since this site would get little traffic at the beginning,
           I am going to focus on recruiters, and prioritize ease of navigation for the website. 
           According to <a href="https://profy.dev/article/portfolio-websites-survey" target="_blank">this website</a>,
           most recruiters look for character, creativity, dedication, and passion in a website. 
           I don’t think I would need to show my credentials, that would be the purpose of my resume.
           Since the point of this website is to showcase my passions, I think that would also be fine. 
           Therefore, I'll focus on simplicity and ease of navigation for everyone.
            This is also very important, as according to <a target="_blank" href="https://profy.dev/article/portfolio-websites-survey">this survey</a>, 
            a recruiter only looks for 55 seconds on average at a resume and portfolio website combined.
          </p>
          <h4>Main Ideas for this Design Sprint</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Simplicity - This site will be for publishing ideas, not maintaining a complex website. Keep It Simple, Stupid!
            </li>
            <li>
                Ease of Navigation - If the audience can't navigate it, they won't stay.
            </li>
            <li>
                Revamping general style - Don't deliberately aim for a minimalist style from the beginning,
                 fill it up with content I like, then remove ones I don't need
            </li>
          </ul>
